Project Description

This library allows you to tap keyboard and mouse and to detect and record their activity even when an application is inactive and runs in background.

This library attaches to windows global hooks, tracks keyboard and mouse clicks and movement and raises common .NET events with KeyEventArgs and MouseEventArgs, so you can easily retrieve any information you need:
Mouse coordinates
Mouse buttons clicked
Mouse wheel scrolls
Key presses and releases
Special key states

Additionally, there are MouseEventExtArgs and KeyEventExtArgs which provide further options:
Input suppression
Timestamp
IsMouseDown/Up
IsKeyDown/Up.
Background

The library is a successor of my CodeProject article Processing Global Mouse and Keyboard Hooks in C# http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/globalhook.aspx. This article was posted in 2004 and updated in 2006 and 2008. With nearly 2.000.000 views and over 25.000 downloads it became quite popular. During all this time until now I receive a lot of positive feedback and recommendations. There where also many useful contributions which where usually posted as code snippets in forum.
